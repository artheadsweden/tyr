# Collective intelligence (Tyr ID-SDLC v0.2)

This folder contains non-executable intelligence artifacts produced by the Learner stage.

Policy for this repository:

- The scoring model documentation is tracked.
- Dynamic outputs (logs and aggregates) are local-only and should remain untracked (see root `.gitignore`).

Intended (local-only) outputs:

- `mission-outcomes.ndjson` (append-only log)
- `friction-zones.json` (aggregated view)
